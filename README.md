## Simulation

The simulation uses `conda` as its package manager. This is because we are following the documentation from `pybox2d`. First, [install `conda` here](https://conda.io/miniconda.html).

```bash
# After you have `conda`, run in the directory the following. This creates a virtual environment with our dependencies.
conda env create

# Activate the environment by:
source activate cfp_simulation

# To run the simulator:
python comprobo_final_project/scripts/simulator/simulator.py
```
